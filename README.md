I don’t reverse to understand. I reverse to laugh.  
Your logic is guesswork. Your defenses are delays.  
Your binary isn’t secure. It’s pathetic.

## WHO I AM

- I reverse engineer low-level software, tear apart binaries, and break things you thought were safe.  
- I don't follow documentation. I follow execution flow.  
- If something runs, I can control it. If it's protected, it's not enough.  
- I don't chase exploits - I create them.  
- You're not ahead. You're just not targeted yet.
